# Web-Based-Object-Detection-and-Analysis-Tool
This project is a C++ CGI web application that processes user-inputted 2D grids and performs object detection and analysis. The program validates the grid dimensions, dynamically allocates memory for 2D arrays, and uses a recursive search algorithm to identify connected objects. For each object, it calculates its size, centroid, and position.

The application also captures user environment details such as IP address, browser, and execution timestamp, and outputs results as dynamically generated HTML reports with error handling and side-by-side object comparisons between two inputs.
